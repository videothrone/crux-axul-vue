# Crux Axul

This is a rebuild of the original [Crux Axul](https://github.com/videothrone/crux-axul) site with Vue 3 in Vite. The goal is / was to create proper dynamic and linkable subpages and an easier way to build the release catalog, w/ the option to connect the whole app to a headless CMS down the line if necessary. I also wanted to re-factor the markup to [BEM](https://getbem.com/) principles and at least implement basic web accessibility.

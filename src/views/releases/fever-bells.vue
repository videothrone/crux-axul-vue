      ✺ 2019 AD. The Arctic Circle and the Amazon are on fire, fascism is on the
      rise again, the gap between the richest and the poorest is still widening.
      New anxieties need to be addressed. Crux Axul has invited seven musicians
      to write and record a piece of music motivated by the way they perceive
      the world changing around them at a seemingly ever-increasing pace. From
      Silicone's flickering exercise in melodic modular experimentation, to YS'
      contemporary take on Musique Concrète, to Shannon Soundquist's longform
      drone meditation, New Anxieties offers seven takes on a world in turmoil
      that are each as unique as they are coherent as a whole. ✺

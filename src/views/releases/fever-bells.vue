          ✺ 2019 AD. The Arctic Circle and the Amazon are on fire, fascism is on
          the rise again, the gap between the richest and the poorest is still
          widening. New anxieties need to be addressed. Crux Axul has invited
          seven musicians to write and record a piece of music motivated by the
          way they perceive the world changing around them at a seemingly
          ever-increasing pace. From Silicone's flickering exercise in melodic
          modular experimentation, to YS' contemporary take on Musique Concrète,
          to Shannon Soundquist's longform drone meditation, New Anxieties
          offers seven takes on a world in turmoil that are each as unique as
          they are coherent as a whole. ✺

Sankt refracts Feral Laws' thunder into a myriad splinter shards and recasts those into a bass-heavy and ice-cold stepper full of caustic twists and turns. His own Among Nights continues this approach with a cavernous skeletal throb accompanied by glassy percussion and ghostly synth occurrences. This throb is slowed down to a glacial crawl in Lymbs' closing remix, lurching forward with fluttering cymbals and replicant nostalgia before it tumbles and floats into oblivion. ✺</p>",

Kolf, best known for his work in metal projects like Valborg or Owl. Here he channels his interests in bass heavy fringe electronics into five tracks of scorched earth rumble and fleeting melodic shimmer.</p><p> The opener Teal and its counterpart, the closer Tear, are exemplary of this. While they seem to buckle under the sheer force of their basslines, that force eventually gives way to rushes of harmony and ambience. In contrast to the almost elliptical nature of these tracks, the ones in between are more propulsive exercises in restraint and texture. Retrait pulses relentlessly around its negative space, Pericon feels like a John Carpenter thumper trapped in a blown out techno cage and Redolent's pads could almost be blissful, if they weren't steadily swallowed by waves of insectile hiss. ✺</p>",

Over seven ever-morphing tracks, Sankt strains the organic and inorganic into various angular new forms. </p><p>Ghosts opens Inganical with eerie granular pads and takes shape quite quickly before bursting into a flurry of breaks. Combustor on the other hand instantly delivers industrial-grade footwork, groaning and moaning for every inch of its life. The title track expands on this formula in an equally agitated but more glitched-out way, shifting between thudding metallic clanks and more playful textural details. Those details come to the fore with disembodied voices floating in and out of the spectrum on the following Zwischen, the EP's fragile midpoint, which soon dissipates into feedback and unease.</p><p>Hydrangea picks up the pace again with its reframed EBM bassline and howling sirens, barreling relentlessly forward, only taking a fleeting pause at an uncanny waterfall. Continuing the onslaught, Goons squelches and squeaks, like a malfunctioning machine on its last legs, while Fogbow provides airy but cold breaks combined with a moody yet catchy bassline. At last <a href='https://linktr.ee/_svnbrg_' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' class='link--inverted'>S S S S (aka Samuel Savenberg)</a> supplies an additional scorching remix of Fowbow, sharpening its edges even more. ✺</p>",

Crux Axul's co-founder Lymbs opens the series and sets the direction it is going to be headed in.</p> <p>The title track Terminal Beaches is arguably Lymbs' most melodic work to date, intricately woven around reverb-drenched choir shivers that are as haunting as they are catchy. As submerged drums and strings surface from below, the track reveals itself to be a rattling stepper, that, while interspersed with various frantic breaks, never loses sight of its widescreen melancholia.</p><p>Slouching Towards Oblivion, the single's other side, introduces its breakbeat pressure with a gnashing bassline and ominously glittering pads before erupting midway into a swirling arpeggio and battering snares and kicks. Morphing its way through various different manifestations of menacing torque, the track disintegrates finally with a dense cloud of cavernous choir and strings. ✺</p>",

Bending and twitching, these throbs manifest as shapeshifting jungle contortions, sometimes cheeky, but mostly straightforward. Demented choral phrases underline the wobble and bluster, before a desolate pad motif is woven into its fabric, giving the push and pull a more sullen tone.</p> <p>On the single's more explorative B-side Thousand Yard Stare, ambient roil and spalls of turmoil take turns. Here, scuttling and filtered drums dance around frosty dub-techno atmospherics, only to erratically and like a force of nature break into bursts of breakbeat recoil. Towards the end, both sides collapse into each other, and as their hissing seams fall apart, only ambience remains. ✺</p>",

Circular Square's seemingly natural skill at crafting exciting interzones of bass-heavy club acrobatics and melodic realms, prime his productions both for adventurous dancefloors and deeper home immersion.</p> <p>As the central piece, 3​-​HT​-​(​xon) finds an equilibrium between its surgical drum stitches, swaths of glassy chimes and rapturous flutes. That balance tips a bit as lush, almost pastoral elements come to the fore half-way through, before the drums regain their ground.</p> <p>Swiveling hi-hats surround a mighty, prowling bass on GBS_02x, an expertly crafted minimalist and stealthy pouncer, that successfully wrings every last drop of momentum out of its carefully selected components. As an welcome addition, <a href='https://linktr.ee/leesemusic' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' class='link--inverted'>Leese's</a> snakey flip reconstructs its stagger into a rolling parade of tribal percussion, intermittent vocal stabs and cavernous drop-outs, mastering the fine art of remixing that is true to the original, while still bearing the unmistakable handwriting of the remixer. ✺</p>",

      "releaseBlurb": "<p>✺  12​.​5h -60° SQ3 marks the return of <a href='https://linktr.ee/circular_square' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' class='link--inverted'>Circular Square</a>, fleshing out in EP-length the interstices of the bass-heavy and melodic club acrobatics he laid out on <a href='/releases/crux-iii-3-ht-xon' target='_self' class='link--inverted'>Crux III: 3​-​HT​-​(​xon)</a>. Proving once again his refined skill at crafting cutting edge sounds, the six playful tracks feel innately alive with the squelchy ghosts inhabiting their soundscapes.</p> <p>Glassy bleeps and percussive pings permeate 4KO-L3, the introductory track, until sleek Drum & Bass propulsions take center stage and a strangely catchy twang of harmonies bounce through the stereo field. 96-EC[labs], on the other hand, one-ups the interplay of glitchy plonks, shifting lower registers and swaying breakbeats, before Oo8hmT turns this formula into a rather spartan stop-and-go of Jungle grimace. </p> <p>In the second half of the EP, J-7(co)B teases with downcast string-like intersections that hint at a beauty lingering below, but a towering bassline and puncturing drums always keep the listener in suspense. D-Tom21 dons an otherworldly instrument that morphs from percussion to strings and back over a shrieking bass in proper half-step mode, while the atmospheric closer K-vHN (9P) adorns its splintered breaks with crystalline chimes, pointing at a bygone and smeared nostalgia, but always remains firmly anchored in the present.  ✺</p>",

      "releaseBlurb": "<p>✺ <a href='https://www.floriansankt.com' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener' class='link--inverted'>Sankt's</a> first full-length album Canopy Drift hones in on previous genre experimentations and offers multiple compelling configurations of ambient, fuzzed-out breaks, IDM and warped electro.</p><p>Washes of birdsong, bleeps and hyaline drones interweave on Eosphoros, the album's opener, laying the ground for the serpentine Underglow, on which a creeping hum of a rhythm is bolstered by snarling bass jolts.<br/>Wryl is where the album really takes up speed, its forward momentum adorned by fractured voice snippets and scuttling high-hats. The tempo is then upped again by Xerosere with its fuzzed-out pads and meticulous breakbeats, before the melancholic Floaters throws a bit of a curveball with crunchy and blown-out 90s electro, broken up by playful glitches and drop-outs.<br/>On Parhelion, a concise exercise in elegiac splendor, bell-like plucks float through the spectrum as the record finds a brief resting place. In contrast, the dubby title track morphs wet sounds and pulsating textures to erratic ends, just as Pfund Dub reframes UK Garage-y shuffles in a minimalist, yet blown-out fashion. <br/>Filtered pads usher in Creeping Nightshade, in which levee-breaking drums relentlessly waltz onward in the company of heavily deconstructed whispers, industrial-sounding squelches and bass salvos.<br/>Time-stretched and curling amen breaks return on the penultimate Peripheral Visions, which is interjected with hazy and sometimes somber organ chords. Noctilucent, the last of the three interconnected ambient pieces structuring Canopy Drift, closes the record out with recoiled piano reductions, as reverb tails droop off into the distance.   ✺</p>",
